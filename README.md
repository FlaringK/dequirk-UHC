# dequrik
A mod for the unoffical homestuck collection. Pretty simple mod, removes quirks on a troll by troll basis. Currently this does not work within flash games. Most trolls (and humans) will still have incorrect casing and missing puncuation due to how they type.

Just download the .js file and place it into your mods folder within your asset pack. Then the mod should show up in the UHC settings, where you can drag it into the active mods list, once there click the settings icon in the corner of the mod to open it's options page, where you can selectively turn on and off troll quirks.
